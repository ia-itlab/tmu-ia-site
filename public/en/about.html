                        <h3>Society today needs designers ready to think big</h3>
                        <p>
                            We are proud of the Department of Industrial Art, Faculty and Graduate School of System
                            Design's unique pairing of product-related and media-related design disciplines within the
                            Metropolitan
                            University's science and engineering departments. Design is not just about creating form,
                            but it's
                            rather
                            about playing an important role in the creation of new products and trends, which the
                            creation is of
                            the
                            concept, it's architecture, or the production and integration of its application. Designers
                            today
                            must not
                            only have specialist knowledge, but they must also be able to take initiative To achieve
                            this, we
                            encourage students to take interest in not only their own specialization, but also the wider
                            world
                            of
                            science and technology, culture and social sciences, popular products and media, and utilize
                            our
                            facilities to explore new types of design by drawing on all of them. Our curriculum is based
                            on : 4
                            years
                            of departmental study followed by 2 years of hands-on professional specialization.
