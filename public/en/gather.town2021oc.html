                    In the Interface Design Studio, we conduct basic and applied research on interfaces, which are the
                    interface between users and computers. In modern life, we are constantly required to operate
                    devices, and these devices are not limited to the mouse and keyboard, but also use input devices
                    such as multi-touch, image processing, gesture recognition, and muscle potential manipulation. By
                    developing, implementing, and proposing these various input devices, we nurture students with the
                    design skills to open up the future.

                    We believe that design is like planting a small seed of "opportunity" for society and the future. At
                    the Interior Design Studio, our starting point is to think about "what it means to live" by
                    connecting humans, society, and nature. We value the sensibility and intelligence of each
                    individual, and through repeated discussions and design trial-and-error. We position design as "the
                    creation of culture through art," and we work on design every day with the aim of supporting
                    people's happiness from both the mental and material aspects. We hope that the students who study
                    design here and leave the nest will become designers who will fascinate the world and sprout
                    wonderful flowers in the future.

                    In the Ergonomic Design Studio, we consider the relationship between people and objects and systems,
                    and examine what kind of design is necessary for people to feel comfortable. For this purpose, we
                    are studying methods of observing people and understanding their behavior and feelings through an
                    ergonomic approach. Our method is to understand the user's experience, visualize it, and design it.
                    From there, I am working on a design approach to find evidence for the creation of things.

                    The field of spatial design intersects with existing disciplines such as architecture, landscape
                    architecture, interior design, and public art. Starting with the question, "What is the meaning of
                    spatial design? We approach this multi-disciplinary design field by starting with the question,
                    "What does spatial design mean? Secondly, the cross-disciplinary education students have received in
                    our department is applied to their research activities from a variety of perspectives, so that they
                    can engage in a flexible and interactive design process. This will enable students to better
                    understand their role as designers, establish new design methods, and engage in a variety of design
                    disciplines.

                    With the development and expansion of information communication systems, everyone has become a
                    sender of information, and editing information such as text, images, sound, and video is already an
                    everyday activity in our lives. Based on this premise, we are reconstructing the editing techniques
                    that have been historically developed, along with theoretical analysis, to develop practical methods
                    of knowledge for the information media age. In particular, from the perspective of connecting
                    digital media such as e-books and physical books, and the history of editing technology and culture,
                    we will design/edit a social system for the creation of new value and communication through the
                    effective use of existing sources, and for a new kind of publicity in the age of information

                    The communication environment supported by the Internet has become an indispensable part of our
                    lives. Digital media technology has enriched people's expression and facilitated the transmission of
                    information, but at the same time, people have become increasingly confused by the vast amount of
                    information. At Network Design Studio, we plan and develop contents, applications, and services
                    based on the unique history and culture of digital media expression, while focusing on the discovery
                    of people's creativity and open technological culture.

                    The relationship between computers and humans is becoming increasingly diverse and deep. In the
                    Software Design Studio, we are studying the relationship between human design activities and
                    computer software. In particular, we are developing a project to support the production of
                    next-generation digital contents. Our research topics include the development of computational
                    algorithms and software that open up new content design, design techniques for efficient development
                    of complex software, and the design of content production processes.

                    Video images can be broadly categorized into live-action images and animated images depending on the
                    production method. In addition to the commonly seen animation, there are various other production
                    methods such as CG animation and stop motion animation using clay. This course is based on lighting,
                    camera work, editing, planning, world view, character setting, scenario, and storyboarding, and adds
                    knowledge specific to animation to understand the principles of animation and learn the basics of
                    its production methods. In addition to the knowledge of live-action images to be shot for live
                    performances, students will also learn the minimum practical skills of live shooting and editing. In
                    addition, students will understand the structure of planning, world view, character setting,
                    scenario, and storyboarding, which are important in video production, especially in drama
                    production.

                    In the Visual Communication Design Studio, we conduct research on the theme of how to create new and
                    universal visual communication, based on what kind of ideas and expressions, in the midst of various
                    changes in social structure, cultural awareness, and production systems. We will conduct research on
                    this theme. We will design the possibilities of visual communication that transcends the realm of
                    media, including graphic design, advertising, packaging, products, space and environment. We believe
                    that the wisdom of design is one of the ways to make our daily lives and society more vibrant in
                    today's society.
